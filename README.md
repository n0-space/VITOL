# VITOL


VITOL (Verbose Iteration Terminal OS Language) Specification

1. Overview

VITOL (Verbose Iteration Terminal OS Language) is a human-readable, iterative command language designed for terminal-based operating systems. It emphasizes explicit syntax, stepwise execution, reversibility, and extensibility to enhance usability and debugging in complex system interactions.

Core Principles:

✅ Self-explanatory syntax → Commands are structured as readable sentences.
✅ Iterative execution → The system allows users to refine, preview, and confirm operations before committing.
✅ Transparent state transitions → Actions provide verbose output on intent, execution, and results.
✅ Reversibility & checkpointing → Users can undo operations via built-in rollback mechanisms.
✅ Cross-language integration → VITOL can be implemented as an interpreter or embedded into existing shells and OS scripting engines.

2. Syntax & Execution Model

VITOL operates on a natural-language-inspired structured syntax, with a flexible hierarchy of execution states.

General Command Format:

[COMMAND] WITH [OPTIONS] FOR [TARGET] AND [CONDITIONS] THEN [FOLLOW-UP]

	•	COMMAND → The primary action to be performed (e.g., CREATE, LIST, DELETE, MOVE).
	•	OPTIONS → Configurable parameters affecting execution (e.g., WITH FULL PERMISSIONS).
	•	TARGET → The object being acted upon (e.g., FILE "report.txt").
	•	CONDITIONS → Constraints on execution (e.g., IF NOT EMPTY).
	•	FOLLOW-UP → Additional post-execution steps (e.g., THEN LOG TO "system.log").

Example Commands & Responses

1️⃣ File Management

COPY FILE "data.csv" TO DIRECTORY "backup" WITH TIMESTAMP THEN CONFIRM SUCCESS

System Response:

[INFO] Copying file: "data.csv" → "backup/data_20250314.csv"
[CONFIRM] Operation successful. Timestamp applied.

2️⃣ User Management

CREATE USER "alice" WITH ADMIN PRIVILEGES THEN NOTIFY SYSTEM LOG

System Response:

[INFO] Creating user: "alice"
[SECURITY] Assigning administrator privileges...
[LOGGED] User "alice" successfully added to system.

3️⃣ Iterative Execution (Preview and Refine Mode)

LIST PROCESSES RUNNING ON PORT 8080 THEN REQUEST CONFIRMATION BEFORE DISPLAYING RESULTS

System Response:

[INFO] Found 2 active processes on port 8080.
[PREVIEW] Display results? (YES / NO / REFINE)

If the user selects REFINE, they can modify filters before execution.

3. Iteration & Reversibility

VITOL features interactive execution modes with built-in rollback options.

Command Flow:
	1.	Parse & Preview Mode
	•	System previews the intended action.
	•	User can refine parameters before execution.
	2.	Execution & Confirmation
	•	The command is executed step by step.
	•	The system provides immediate feedback.
	3.	Rollback & Recovery
	•	Actions are reversible if marked WITH UNDO ENABLED.
	•	Checkpoints allow users to revert changes.

Example of Rollback Support

DELETE DIRECTORY "old_logs" WITH UNDO ENABLED THEN CONFIRM DELETION

System Response:

[INFO] Deleting directory: "old_logs"
[WARN] This action is reversible within 5 minutes.
[CONFIRM] Directory deleted. Undo with: RESTORE LAST ACTION

User can restore via:

RESTORE LAST ACTION

4. Multi-Language Ports

VITOL can be implemented across multiple programming languages and OS environments:

Language	Implementation Approach
Bash	Aliases & wrapper scripts using eval
Python	Interpreter using argparse & subprocess
Go	System API bindings with os/exec
Rust	CLI application with structopt
PowerShell	Cmdlet-based implementation
C	Embedded system scripting

Example Implementations in Different Languages

1️⃣ Bash (Simple Wrapper)

function vitol() {
    case "$1" in
        "LIST")
            ls $3
            ;;
        "COPY")
            cp $3 $5
            echo "[CONFIRM] Copied $3 to $5"
            ;;
        *)
            echo "[ERROR] Unknown command"
            ;;
    esac
}
vitol LIST FILES IN "/home/user"

2️⃣ Python (Basic Interpreter)

import os

def vitol(command):
    tokens = command.split()
    if tokens[0] == "LIST" and "FILES" in tokens:
        directory = tokens[-1]
        print("[INFO] Listing files in:", directory)
        print(os.listdir(directory))
    elif tokens[0] == "COPY":
        src, dest = tokens[2], tokens[4]
        os.system(f"cp {src} {dest}")
        print(f"[CONFIRM] Copied {src} to {dest}")
    else:
        print("[ERROR] Unknown command")

vitol("LIST FILES IN /home/user")

3️⃣ Go (CLI Interpreter)

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"os/exec"
)

func vitol(command string) {
	switch {
	case command[:4] == "LIST":
		dir := command[14:]
		files, _ := os.ReadDir(dir)
		fmt.Println("[INFO] Listing files in:", dir)
		for _, file := range files {
			fmt.Println(file.Name())
		}
	case command[:4] == "COPY":
		parts := strings.Split(command, " ")
		src, dest := parts[2], parts[4]
		cmd := exec.Command("cp", src, dest)
		cmd.Run()
		fmt.Println("[CONFIRM] Copied", src, "to", dest)
	default:
		fmt.Println("[ERROR] Unknown command")
	}
}

func main() {
	vitol("LIST FILES IN /home/user")
}

VITOL (Verbose Iteration Terminal OS Language) Specification – Advanced Features

VITOL is designed to bring clarity, reversibility, and interactivity to system administration, automation, and OS command execution. This section expands on its advanced features, including error handling, multi-stage execution, dynamic variables, macro definitions, scripting capabilities, and multi-language ports.

⸻

1. Advanced Command Handling & Execution Models

1.1 Interactive Execution with Stepwise Confirmation

VITOL supports multi-step execution with inline previews, letting users refine commands before committing.

Example: Safe File Deletion

DELETE ALL FILES IN "logs" OLDER THAN 30 DAYS THEN REQUEST CONFIRMATION

System Response:

[INFO] Found 12 files matching criteria.
[PREVIEW] Display file list? (YES/NO/REFINE)

If the user selects REFINE, they can adjust the search criteria without retyping the full command.

⸻

1.2 Execution Checkpoints & Rollback

Each operation automatically generates a checkpoint before modification, allowing for seamless rollback.

Example: Undoing an Accidental File Move

MOVE FILES FROM "Downloads" TO "Documents"

If a mistake is detected, the user can run:

ROLLBACK LAST ACTION

System Response:

[UNDO] Reverting file move. Restoring "Downloads" to previous state.
[CONFIRM] Operation undone.



⸻

2. Error Handling & Debugging Mechanisms

2.1 Adaptive Error Handling

When a command fails, VITOL offers context-aware suggestions and guided recovery options.

Example: Attempting to Delete a Locked File

DELETE FILE "important.txt"

System Response:

[ERROR] File "important.txt" is locked by process ID 5721.
[SUGGEST] Would you like to:
  (1) Terminate process 5721?
  (2) Schedule deletion on next reboot?
  (3) Skip this file and continue?

Users can select an automated fix or refine their approach interactively.

⸻

2.2 Debugging Mode

Users can invoke verbose debugging for any command to see system logs, execution paths, and performance metrics.

Example: Debugging a Script Execution

RUN SCRIPT "backup.vitol" WITH DEBUG MODE

System Response:

[DEBUG] Starting script execution: backup.vitol
[DEBUG] Step 1: Checking available disk space...
[DEBUG] Step 2: Copying files...
[ERROR] Disk quota exceeded. 
[SUGGEST] Free up space or reduce backup size?



⸻

3. Dynamic Variables, Macros, and Scripting

3.1 Variable Support for Dynamic Input Handling

Users can define and use variables within commands, making repetitive tasks easier.

Example: Using a Variable for User Management

SET $NEW_USER TO "alice"
CREATE USER $NEW_USER WITH STANDARD PRIVILEGES

System Response:

[INFO] Created user: alice

Variables can also store file paths, timestamps, process IDs, and more.

⸻

3.2 Macros for Complex Command Sequences

Users can define macros to bundle multiple commands into a single reusable operation.

Example: Defining a Cleanup Macro

DEFINE MACRO CLEANUP_LOGS AS:
  DELETE ALL FILES IN "logs" OLDER THAN 30 DAYS
  THEN LOG ACTION TO "system.log"
  THEN NOTIFY ADMIN "Logs Cleaned"

To execute:

RUN CLEANUP_LOGS



⸻

3.3 Conditional & Loop Execution

VITOL supports IF-ELSE logic, loops, and event-driven execution.

Example: Automated Disk Cleanup Script

IF FREE SPACE IN "C:" IS LESS THAN 10GB THEN:
  DELETE TEMP FILES IN "C:\\Temp"
  MOVE OLD BACKUPS TO "D:\\Archive"
  THEN LOG ACTION
ELSE:
  PRINT "Sufficient space available."



⸻

4. Multi-Language Ports & Integration

VITOL can be implemented as:
✅ A standalone terminal language (own interpreter)
✅ A module within existing shells (Bash, PowerShell, Zsh)
✅ A scripting language integrated with Python, Rust, or Go

4.1 Example Implementations

4.1.1 Bash Shell Integration

VITOL commands can be converted into Bash equivalents dynamically.

VITOL Command:

COPY FILE "data.csv" TO "backup" WITH TIMESTAMP

Bash Equivalent:

cp data.csv "backup/data_$(date +%Y%m%d).csv"

4.1.2 Python API Binding

A Python interface could execute VITOL commands programmatically:

import vitol

vitol.execute("COPY FILE 'data.csv' TO 'backup' WITH TIMESTAMP")

4.1.3 Rust-Based CLI Integration

VITOL could serve as a CLI wrapper in Rust:

let command = "COPY FILE 'data.csv' TO 'backup' WITH TIMESTAMP";
vitol::execute(command);



⸻

5. Future Expansion & Use Cases

✅ DevOps Automation → Human-friendly server provisioning scripts
✅ SysAdmin Tasks → Safe, interactive command execution
✅ Security & Compliance → Verbose logging and rollback protection
✅ End-User Shell Alternative → More intuitive than Bash for casual users
✅ Smart Contracts & Bitcoin Nodes → Possible applications in HTLC-based migration
